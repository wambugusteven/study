        <ul>
        <li> <p>Information processed by a computer is in 0s and 1s</p> </li>
        <li> <p> How a computrer works depends on the voltage of each and every cable.
            That is whether High or low voltage.
        </p> </li>
        <p> Von Neumann Machine is a basic model that explains how a computer works.</p>

        <h1>The Recurring Themes</h1>
        <p>There are two recurring themes: 
            <ul>
                <li>Notion of abrassion</li>
                <li>Notion of hardware and software</li>
             </ul>   
        </p>
     <h2>Notion of Absrtaction</h2>
        <p>Abstraction- its a technique for hiding complex infrmation and showing the simpler Information</p>
        <p>Deconstruction- Its the ability to reverse absrtaction</p>
        <p>Computers are composed of trasistors which combine to form a <em>Logic Gate</em></p>
        <p>Several combination of logic gates form <em>Logic Circuits</em></p>
        <p>Abstraction enables us to deal with all kind of situations</p>
     <h3>Notion of Hardware and Software</h3>
        <p>Hardware is the physical part of a computer and all specification associated with it while software
            is the programs running in a computer. </p>
         <head>
            <title> Computer System</title>
            </head>
            <p>- it is the combination of hardware and software where software directs and specifies the processing 
                of information and the hardware part of it performs the actual processing.
            </p>
            <h4>Parts of a computer system</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Keyboard</li>
                <li>Mouse</li>
                <li>Monitor</li>
                <li>Memory Disk</li>
